    <h2>Ancient India</h2>
    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from
        Africa.[28][29][30] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[28]
        After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and
        storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These
        gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which
        flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro,
        Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged
        robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]

        During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to
        the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this
        period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper
        Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan
        migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests,
        warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose
        during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence
        of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated
        by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of
        agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]


        Cave 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves
        In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the
        north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the
        mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became
        independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism,
        based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle
        class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in
        India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98]
        and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of
        Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Maurya Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to
        have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been
        separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and
        determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the
        Buddhist dhamma.[102][103]

        The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was
        ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and
        with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family,
        leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created
        a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for
        later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the
        management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and
        architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and
        Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.</p>

    <h2>Medieval India</h2>
    <p>The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110]
        When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand
        southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand
        eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards,
        they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas
        from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control
        lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to
        make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new
        non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]

        In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were
        imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages
        of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great
        numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to
        appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were
        felt in Southeast Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of
        modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian
        merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; Southeast Asians took the
        initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into
        their languages.[115]

        After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies
        united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to
        the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India
        and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate
        largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly
        repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and
        Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders,
        artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture
        in the north.[119][120] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the
        way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the
        military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to
        influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]</p>

    <h2 id="EMI">Early modern India</h2>
    <p>In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior
        mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not
        stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative
        practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and
        uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their
        far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine
        status.[127] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and mandating
        that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger
        markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in
        India's economic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and
        architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the
        Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration
        or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule
        gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As
        the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]

        A two mohur Company gold coin, issued in 1835, the obverse inscribed "William IIII, King"
        By the early 18th century, with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred,
        a number of European trading companies, including the English East India Company, had established coastal
        outposts.[134][135] The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military
        training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive
        to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the
        Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.[136][134][137][138] Its further access to the
        riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most
        of India by the 1820s.[139] India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had, but was
        instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials. Many historians consider this to be the onset of
        India's colonial period.[134] By this time, with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament
        and having effectively been made an arm of British administration, the East India Company began more consciously
        to enter non-economic arenas, including education, social reform, and culture</p>

    <h2 id="MI">Modern India</h2>
    <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment in 1848 of
        Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern
        state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and
        the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced
        not long after their introduction in Europe.[141][142][143][144] However, disaffection with the company also
        grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions,
        including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners
        and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of
        Company rule.[145][146] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of the East
        India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary state and
        a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed
        gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest.[147][148] In the decades following, public life gradually
        emerged all over India, leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in
        1885.[149][150][151][152]

        The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was
        marked by economic setbacks, and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[153]
        There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines,[154] and, despite the risks of infrastructure
        development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[155] There were
        also salutary effects: commercial cropping, especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food
        production for internal consumption.[156] The railway network provided critical famine relief,[157] notably
        reduced the cost of moving goods,[157] and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.[156]

        Jawaharlal Nehru sharing a light moment with Mahatma Gandhi, Mumbai, 6 July 1946
        After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[158] a new period began. It was marked by
        British reforms but also repressive legislation, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule, and by the
        beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and
        enduring symbol.[159] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National
        Congress won victories in the resulting elections.[160] The next decade was beset with crises: Indian
        participation in World War II, the Congress's final push for non-co-operation, and an upsurge of Muslim
        nationalism. All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947, but tempered by the partition of India into
        two states: India and Pakistan.[161]

        Vital to India's self-image as an independent nation was its constitution, completed in 1950, which put in place
        a secular and democratic republic.[162] Economic liberalisation, which began in the 1980s and the collaboration
        with Soviet Union for technical know-how,[163] has created a large urban middle class, transformed India into
        one of the world's fastest-growing economies,[164] and increased its geopolitical clout. Yet, India is also
        shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty, both rural and urban;[165] by religious and caste-related violence;[166]
        by Maoist-inspired Naxalite insurgencies;[167] and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast
        India.[168] It has unresolved territorial disputes with China[169] and with Pakistan.[169] India's sustained
        democratic freedoms are unique among the world's newer nations; however, in spite of its recent economic
        successes, freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved</p>
